# CCC151 Student Information System 🎓

A lightweight, CSV-backed desktop application for managing Students, Programs, and Colleges — built with Go and Wails for a native desktop experience with no external database required.


The CCC151 Student Information System is a fully offline desktop app built on the [Wails](https://wails.io/) framework, combining a Go backend with a plain JavaScript frontend. All data is persisted to local CSV files, making it portable and easy to set up with zero configuration. The app supports full CRUD operations across three core entities — Students, Programs, and College.

---

## Highlights ✅

- Three fully managed directories: Students, Programs, and Colleges
- Create, read, update, delete, and list flows with validation
- Local CSV storage — no database, no setup, fully portable
- Fast in-memory search across all fields
- Concurrent-safe file access using `sync.RWMutex`
- Automatic data directory resolution regardless of executable location
- Native desktop window via Wails — ships as a single `.exe`

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- [Go 1.21+](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [Wails v2](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation) (https://wails.io/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) — required internally by Wails

```bash
go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest
```

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codex-coderex/ccc151-student-system.git
cd ccc151-student-system
wails dev
```

### Production Build

```bash
wails build
# output: build/bin/student-system.exe
```

> **Note:** Move `student-system.exe` out of `build/bin/` and into the project root before running it, so it can locate the `data/` folder correctly.

## Package Documentation 📦

| Package | Responsibility |
|---------|---------------|
| `models` | Defines the `Student`, `Program`, and `College` structs |
| `storage` | Reads, writes, and appends to CSV files — all calls are mutex-protected |
| `services` | Business logic — CRUDL operations with duplicate checking and error handling |
| `app.go` | Wails bindings — exposes service functions to the frontend as `window.go.main.App.MethodName()` |

Each entity in `services` follows the same pattern: `List`, `Get`, `Add`, `Update`, `Delete`. The `storage` package handles the actual file I/O and includes a `resolvePath` helper that walks up from the executable to find the `data/` folder automatically.

---

## TODO 📋

- [ ] CSV import and export for bulk data entry
- [ ] User authentication with role-based access — admins manage colleges and programs, regular users manage student records only
- [ ] Dashboard page with enrollment statistics and graphs by program, college, year level, and gender
- [ ] Cascading deletes — removing a college or program flags or updates dependent records
- [ ] Packaged installer for distribution without manual setup
- [ ] Stricter input validation — ID format, field length limits, duplicate name detection
- [ ] Audit log to track record changes over time

---

## Known Limitations ⚠️

- CSV storage is not suitable for concurrent multi-user access — this is a single-user desktop app
- Deleting a college or program does not update student or program records that reference it
- No authentication or access control in the current version
